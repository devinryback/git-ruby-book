# This code throws the following error message:

# exercise.rb:8: syntax error, unexpected end-of-input, expecting keyword_end

# Why? And how to fix this code?

def equal_to_four(x)
  if x == 4
    puts "yup"
  else
    puts "nope"
end

# Ruby is expecting an "end" for the if/else statement. I can fix this code by adding "end" after line 11, and moving the following end to the next line:

def equal_to_four(x)
  if x == 4
    puts "yup"
  else
    puts "nope"
  end
end


### LS solution

# You get this error because the end in the code above gets matched with the if..else statement. The error message is telling us that the interpreter was expecting the keyword end to close off our equal_to_four method, that end was not found.
