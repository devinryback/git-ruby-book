What does the following error message tell you?

ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'


Ruby method was expecting 2 arguments and was passed only one.

Example:

def example(x, y)
  x + y
end

example(5)

^^ This would create the error because only one argument is passed to the example method, which expects 2.


### LS solution

You are calling a method called calculate_product that requires two arguments, but you are only providing one.
