# What's the difference between these two hashes?

x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

# No difference besides their names


### LS solution

# The first hash that was created used a symbol x as the key. The second hash used the string value of the x variable as the key.

# ^^ Yes, I know this.
